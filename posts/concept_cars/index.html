      <p>If you have been following our progress with the wind tunnel, you will be excited to learn that we have started to work on concepts for our car design.
<a href="/img/trone.png"><figure><img src="/img/trone.png"
    alt="Concept Car Design One" width="50%">
</figure>
</a></p>
<p>For our first concept design, we have optly named it &ldquo;TRONE&rdquo;: the &ldquo;TR&rdquo; stands for Titanium Racing, and ONE is because it is our first concept.
The front wing is short and pointy to give maximum aerodynamics down the 20 metre straight track.
The back wing and sidepods are joined up to conserve weight for faster acceleration.</p>
<p><a href="/img/trtwo.png"><figure><img src="/img/trtwo.png"
    alt="Concept Car Design Two" width="50%">
</figure>
</a></p>
<p>Our second design is named it &ldquo;TRTWO&rdquo;, similar to the TRONE but with &ldquo;TWO&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;ONE&rdquo; since it is our second concept design.
The front wing is swept back to pierce through the air.
The sidepod is on the smaller end and curvy to provide optimal airflow and reduce the amount of weight it will add to the car.
The back wing is oval shaped to allow the air to travel through the middle and reduce drag.</p>
<p>In F1, the team engineers use a similar method called DRS (drag reduction system) which assits them going down straights.
In F1 in schools, the whole track is straight, so this design adopts this type of back wing permanently as a fixed version.</p>
<p><a href="/img/trthree.png"><figure><img src="/img/trthree.png"
    alt="Concept Car Design Three" width="50%">
</figure>
</a></p>
<p>For our third design, is aptly named &ldquo;TRTHREE&rdquo; same as the last design name but with the three instead of the two to symbolise that it is the third design.
The front wing is straight and very compact to have minimal weight contribution and drag.
The sidepod is very small, close to the no-go zone rule to have a really low weight, and there is also a curve to provide better aerodynamics.
The back wing is very similar to the TRTWO, being in an oval shape to reduce drag by letting the air travel through the middle.</p>
<p>The team now working hard on bringing our concepts to life. Come back soon to check out our progress.</p>
